          <h1>Attack on Titan<br><span>Eren Yeager</span></h1>
          <p>it is undoubtedly one of the most popular anime of all time, and will likely go down in history as an all-time classic. 
            With the show's fourth, and final season set to air this December, I thought it would be a good time to revisit this anime,
             and try to understand what makes Attack on Titan such a good show.</p>

          <p>Makunouchi Ippo is an ordinary high school student in Japan. Since he spends most of his time away from school 
            helping his mother run the family business, he doesn't get to enjoy his younger years like most teenagers. Always a target
             for bullying at school (the family fishing business grants him a distinct odor), Ippo's life is one of hardship.</p>
